# potatio
Potatio is a programming language created specifically to be transpiled into other languages. It does not compile/interpret on its own, but it can be converted to other programming languages.

# Wonder how it works?

Well, potatio first converts a string of given code into a specific data structure, then the data structure is saved into memory. The user can choose a language, or select the default "c++" language.

Then, the data structure will be converted into a code of the given language, and outputted to the user. The user can choose wether to compile the output, or leave it as it is.

# Can i test it?

Sure! Go to the output directory and download and execute `potatio.exe`!

# How can i be sure that it isn't malware?

Build it for yourself!
It's quite easy, just double-click `publish.exe` or `publish.bat` to make a release.
Then, head over to `potatio/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/win-x64/publish/` and you will be able to see the built potatio file. Good luck!
