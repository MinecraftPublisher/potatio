# potatio
Potatio is a programming language created specifically to be transpiled into other languages. It does not compile/interpret on its own, but it can be converted to other programming languages.

# Wonder how it works?

Well, potatio first converts a string of given code into a specific data structure, then the data structure is saved into memory. The user can choose a language, or select the default "c++" language.

Then, the data structure will be converted into a code of the given language, and outputted to the user. The user can choose wether to compile the output, or leave it as it is.
